            <h2>I will tell you a little something about me:</h2>
            <p>My name is K. Sunny Siu. I am an assistant professor here at RCC for the Applied Digital Media and Printing Department. I have a BFE in Entertainment Art, aka animation, and a MFA in Illustration. I have taught everything from <em>traditional animation, digital animation, motion graphics, graphic design, illustration, life drawing, character design, storyboard, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, Web Design, and the list goes on</em></p>
            <p>Unlike most of my designer peers, I actually like studying codes; especially web languages. I enjoy learning all about the rapidly evolving web design/development world. I aspire to become a unicorn designer - someone who can design and program equally well. I also find the area of User Experience interesting because I believe UX is where today's new frontier is for graphic designers</p>
            <p>I am 49, and I can proudly say that I have been <strong>a gamer for over 40 years</strong>. My earliest gaming memories were games on my Apple IIe with games like Karateka, Loderunner, Donkey Kong(1981), Mario Bros(1983), and many more. I like many genres of games: RPG, FPS, classic 80s arcades, survival horror of the late 90s and fighting. Speaking of fighting games, I was there when Street Fighter first came out in the arcade in 1987 and then SFII in 1991.</p>
