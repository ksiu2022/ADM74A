            <p>Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.</p>
            
          <p>There are only four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook, and uppercut. Several basic defensive maneuvers are used by boxers: slipping, bobbing, blocking, cover-up, clinching, and footwork. The different boxing styles include out-fighter, boxer-puncher, counter puncher, brawler, and in-fighter.</p>
            
          <p>Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Boxing practitioners utilize several types of training equipment: speed bag, double-end bag, heavy bag, focus mitt, jump rope, and others.</p>
